# Thoughts
This is a place for me to put up different little ramblings.

*Using GitHub as a blog* Yes I am stupid. Watch me use this as a gallery next.  
This really is just for me to pen my thoughts while I'm at my computer.  
I don't like using GDocs for this; having all my ramblings scattered on drive makes things messy.  
Also I think writing in markdown is cool as hell, so there's that.
