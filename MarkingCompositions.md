# Marking Compositions

## Open, 0551hrs, 14/06/2022

Writing this in the middle of a little assignment that I took up.

For context, I was introduced to this job where I mark primary school English compositions for a tuition centre for 10$ each.  
Had to mark 10 scripts overnight due to my procrastination so my dissatisfaction with the tuition centre's methods has already reached a certain point.  
Saw the chance to mark 5 scripts overnight so I thought why not.  
And man, I really can't say that I agree with their methods.  
Perhaps it's the instructions I was given, but there are so many fundamental issues in the compositions I've seen that need to be addressed but cannot, well, at least not by me.  
But I hope to god they will be.  
Because if all I can do is tell them to follow formats... if I'm limited in the length of the comments I am allowed to write... if the teachers do not address these issues...  
These kids are well and truly <span style="color:red">**fucked**</span>.

There's so much about writing flow, good writing habits, and writing mistakes to avoid that these kids don't look like they're being taught, at least from what I see from the teaching material that is given to me to grade these pieces off of.  
I'm not writing this to make this tuition centre look bad, nor am I trying to say that I'd be a good teacher or anything, but the constraints I've been given have made marking these scripts extremely difficult for me mentally, since I'm even given a **format** to follow when giving comments and corrections. And heck while I'm not under any contract or anything, I'm kinda afraid of deviating from this format just to address these concerns I feel so strongly about. I really *really* don't mean to be a suckup or anything, but if this affects how "quality" my marking is to the tuition centre and might catch me flak, I want to mess with none of it.

Edit: Yes, I am allowed to mark for grammar and spelling. Thank god I can do that at least.  
But coherence and writing flow isn't something they've explicitly told us to mark :pensive:

*reassuring myself* As long as I follow whatever is printed, I should be fine... right... right.???
